# 🛰️ QuiverPay — DePIN Infrastructure for Off-Ramping Crypto to Real-World Services with USDC

**QuiverPay** is a decentralized payment network that enables users to off-ramp stablecoins like **USDC** into real-world services, such as **airtime**, **mobile data**, **electricity payments**, and **bank transfers**.
