# QuiverPay 💸

**Pay bills with crypto. Backed by DePIN. Built on Base.**

QuiverPay is a decentralized payment network (DePIN) that lets users pay real-world utility bills using stablecoins like USDC or DAI. Whether you're paying for electricity, water, or internet, you can do it directly from your crypto wallet — no conversion hassles, no middlemen.

## ✨ Key Features

### ✅ Real-World Bill Payments

Pay utility bills directly using your crypto. Just connect your wallet, select a biller, and send stablecoins.

### 🔁 Real-Time Stablecoin Pricing

We lock in the USD value when you create a payment request and calculate exactly how much crypto you need to send.

### 🔐 Smart Contract Powered

All payments and staking are handled securely on-chain. No need to trust a middleman.

### 🧾 Refundable Transactions

If a user sends incorrect or invalid payment data (e.g. wrong account number), node operators can **issue a refund** from the smart contract.
They’re rewarded **0.05 USDC** for handling the failed request responsibly.

### 🌐 Node Operators Earn with Staking

Node runners stake ETH to process user transactions. The more they stake, the more requests they can handle and earn from.

### 📈 Node Reputation & Limits

Each node's capacity is based on:

* How much ETH they've staked
* Their reliability (success rate and uptime)
* Community trust signals

### 🕒 4-Hour Backend Sync

To optimize efficiency, transaction data is cached off-chain for 4-hour windows and then synced to the blockchain.

### 🛠 Built on Base

We use the Base network for fast, affordable, and secure on-chain activity.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User connects wallet** → Picks a biller → Gets a live USD quote → Sends stablecoins
2. **Smart contract** escrows funds and logs the transaction
3. **Node operator** processes the request → Pays the fiat bill → Gets reimbursed + a fee
4. **If data is bad**, node can **issue a refund** → Receives a **0.05 USDC** reward
5. **Backend** syncs recent off-chain data to chain every 4 hours

## 🌍 Future Plans

* Support for more countries and bill types
* Cross-chain payments
* Community governance and staking pools
* Gamified rewards for both users and node operators

---

## 🧑‍💻 Who It’s For

* People who earn in crypto but pay bills in fiat
* Web3 users looking for real-world utility
* Node operators seeking on-chain earning opportunities

**QuiverPay** makes crypto usable in your everyday life. Just pay and go — no banks needed.
